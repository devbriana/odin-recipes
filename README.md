# Odin Recipes

The purpose of Odin Recipes is to practice using HTML through The Odin Project and create a basic index to link to various websites.

This project also provided an opportunity for me to practice staging and committing changes to Git for the first time.

## Features

- **HTML Practice**: Learn the basics of HTML by building a simple recipe website.
- **Linking**: Understand how to link between different pages and external resources.
